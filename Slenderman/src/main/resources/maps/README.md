We can use this txt method to create maps using a simple convention. 
- Each entry to the map matrix must consist of a char (ie. W for wall, or G for ground) and an integer (ranging from however many tiles we choose to instantiate for ground and wall class)
- Eg. "W1" will refer to wall type, and 1 specifies the specific wall tile (eg. tree tile).
